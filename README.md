## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 or higher (Python 3.8+ supported)
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

### Setup
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The requirements.txt includes:
- PyQt5 (5.15.11) - GUI framework
- pandas (2.3.3+) - Data analysis
- numpy (1.26.4+) - Numerical computing
- capstone (5.0.6) - Disassembly engine
- networkx (3.6.1) - Control flow analysis

3. Run the main decompiler:
```bash
python ex4_debug_decompiler.py
```

## Usage

1. Launch the application
2. Select your target language from the dropdown:
   - MQL4 (MetaTrader 4)
   - MQL5 (MetaTrader 5)
   - Python
   - C
   - R
   - Text (Plain description)

3. Click "Select EX4 File" and choose your .ex4 file
4. View results in three tabs:
   - Analysis: Raw analysis data in JSON format
   - Pseudocode: Generated code in selected language
   - Debug Log: Detailed analysis process and any errors

5. Save your results:
   - "Save Analysis": Saves the raw analysis as JSON
   - "Save Pseudocode": Saves the generated code in appropriate format

## Limitations

### Resolved/Improved Limitations ✅
1. **Pattern Recognition** ✅ IMPROVED
   - ✅ Now includes 40+ MT4/MT5 function patterns
   - ✅ Detects trading strategies (martingale, grid, hedging, scalping, etc.)
   - ✅ Identifies risk management features
   - ✅ Detects timeframe usage patterns
   - ⚠ May still miss highly custom implementations

2. **Code Generation** ✅ IMPROVED
   - ✅ Python code now includes type hints and comprehensive class structure
   - ✅ MQL4 code includes detailed headers and comments
   - ✅ Input parameters are inferred with correct data types
   - ✅ Text descriptions provide comprehensive analysis reports
   - ⚠ Generated code still requires manual review for edge cases

3. **Analysis Depth** ✅ IMPROVED
   - ✅ Enhanced string extraction with Unicode (UTF-16LE) support
   - ✅ PE header analysis extracts compilation timestamps
   - ✅ Metadata extraction includes copyright, author, description
   - ✅ String categorization (functions, parameters, indicators, etc.)
   - ✅ File statistics including entropy calculation
   - ⚠ Deep nested functions may still be flattened

### Remaining Limitations
1. **Decompilation Accuracy** ⚠
   - ❌ Cannot recover original variable names (inherent limitation)
   - ❌ Complex logic may be simplified
   - ⚠ Custom indicators detection improved but may not be fully reconstructed

2. **Full Source Recovery** ❌
   - ❌ Original source code cannot be exactly reconstructed (inherent limitation)
   - ❌ Original comments are lost (inherent limitation)
   - ❌ Original code structure may differ
   - ✅ BUT: Improved parameter names and types help understand intent

   - ❌ Proprietary functions remain obfuscated
   - ✅ Trading logic patterns are now better detected

4. **Optimization Recovery** ❌
   - ❌ Compiler optimizations are permanent (inherent limitation)
   - ❌ Original performance tweaks are lost (inherent limitation)
   - ❌ Memory management patterns are simplified (inherent limitation)
